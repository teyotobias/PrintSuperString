# PrintSuperString
Prints all superstrings of given string.

Given text files include sample strings, sample superstrings, and correct output consisting of all superstrings of given strings.

A superstring S of a string s is a char array such that if we remove 0 or more chars from S, we get s.

Examples:
superstrings of hello: hello, xhxexlxlox, helolo 
non-superstrings of hello: helo, helon, sandwich

S and s consist of only letters, upper- and lower-case. A word is a sequence of one or more letters with no intervening whitespace. Whitespace characters can occur anywhere at the start, just before the final null termination, or anywhere between words. Characters are case-sensitive.
